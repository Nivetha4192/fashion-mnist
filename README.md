# fashion-mnist
The data set is called Fashion-MNIST. Similar, to NIST data, there are ten classes, showing pictures of clothing items. These items are stored in a low-resolution 28_28 images made up of integers between zero and representing the grey scale of the pixel they are representing. This script is implementing a one{hidden-layer neural network to learn various clothing items. Keras Sequential approach is used here to  building my neural network. I have also used ReLU activation function for the layer. In the next step, I have also used the functional model to try the same on the dataset. The Python script that runs through the test data. For each one of my model that is being predicted incorrectly, it will draw the pattern, and also show the value of the predicted softmax function for this incorrectly classified pattern.  the percentage of times the second choice was the correct one will also be printed.
